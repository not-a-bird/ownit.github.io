This is going to be totally mediocre!

Adding new content
------------------

1. clone the repo
2. change the content
3. push the changes
4. no really, that's it


A note about cloning the repo: you definitely want to use your ssh key so you
don't have to screw with usernames and password...

**AFTER** uploading your key to your profile and requesting access...

``` .bash
    git clone git@github.com:not-a-bird/ownit.github.io.git
```
